> english / chinese（next page）

### 1 warning
Number-X is more than just a card game, it is also a psychological game. As an Ethereum DAPP, the Number-X team is committed to developing a blockchain application that is fair, non-following, and sharing revenue for everyone. Through a long test, we opened up such a card game. However, please note that any Ethereum that illegally transfers eth to number-x may be lost.

### 2 introduce
The inspiration for the number-x game came from the traditional card gambling game at 21 o'clock. However, we have enriched its gameplay, raised it to a value of 100 points, and added a promoter mechanism to allow players to re-list and join the mechanism of segmentation. If they exceed a certain value, they will be rewarded. There is no bookmaker or initial Funds. through a pre-statistical and algorithmic calculation to get a reasonable prize pool, all the players won the reward will not appear to be unable to make ends meet.

### 3 rules & bonus
1. each payment of 'next card' gets a number card, and the value is deducted to the jackpot.

2. there is no limit to the payment times  (1-100]

3. When the sum of the digital cards is in the range of (80,86], the rewards of current round is 1.1 times the total investment.(43~81% to win)
4. When the sum of the digital cards is in the range of (86,92], the rewards of current round is 1.3 times the total investment.
5. When the sum of the digital cards is in the range of (92,97], the rewards of current round is 1.6 times the total investment.

4. When the sum of the digital cards is in the range of [98,99], the rewards of current round is 2.3 times the total investment.

5. The permanent lucky number is 100, but another lucky number will be generated every hour, when the sum of the digital cards is in [100 or lucky number], it will be settled immediately and player can get a bonus of 3.6 times the investment plus 5% of the jackpot. 

6. When the sum of digital cards is in the range (0,33] and more than 3 cards have been drawn, it will be settled immediately. player can also get 3.6 times the bonus and add 10% of the jackpot.

7. When the sum exceeds 100, there is no gain, and the investment will enter the lucky pool. The same every hour will generate a demon number, which will change between 85 and 99. If the sum is equal to this number, the current invest will be confiscated. But please rest assured that after probabilistic testing, the probability is less than 1%。

8. When the sum of the digital cards does not exceed 100, the player can end the current round at any time. If the sum of the cards is less than 80 at the end (that is, the round does not receive a profit), only the stop loss can be 50%. The remaining into the jackpot.

9. Each time a player promotes a player, they will get a chance to re-draw. Each round of the game can only be used once again. A re-sampling opportunity can only be used every 1 hours.

10. If player A promotes a player B, player A can get a chance to re-pull if the amount of Ethereum in which player B participates in the game reaches 0.1 eth.
11. If the jackpot is not enough for players, we will put the team's income into the lucky pool to make up for the lack of points,Although this situation is very unlikely. we will show the reason below.
12. We created a bonus robot, we will open the jackpot every day, and the eth of some of the prize pools will be distributed to all the players who are not cashed out according to the player's investment ratio. The more the investment, the more eth rewards can be divided!

### 4 testing
> The table below shows our test results. The probability of gaining revenue from 500 players to 10,000 players playing games was tested in batches. The results of player input and revenue are displayed in batches.We simulate the results of the user's winning awards, and whether they choose to continue to draw or give up this round of heart activity. We can see that players have a high probability of receiving rewards, and all rewards come from each player's input. It's fairly fair, and it won't make ends meet.

>ps: 
>1 luckyNum includes(100 and the lucky number each round)
>2 The form is calculated based on the player’s trading volume of 0.1eth per card.

### 規則和獎勵
1. 每付壹次款 獲得1張數字牌 費用將進入幸運獎池。

2. 每輪可以無限次付款獲得數字卡牌 [1-100]，直至超過100
3. 當數字卡牌之和 處於 [80,86]區間 獲得 1.1倍投入獎勵 (43.7~81% to win)
4. 當數字卡牌之和 處於 (86,92]區間 獲得 1.3倍投入獎勵 
4. 當數字卡牌之和 處於 (92,97]區間 獲得 1.6倍投入獎勵 
5. 當數字卡牌之和 處於 [98,99]區間 獲得 2.3倍投入獎勵
